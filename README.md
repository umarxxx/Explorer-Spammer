## Features

- **Light-hearted Prank**: Spams File Explorer windows for entertainment.
- **Easy to Use**: Simple commands make it accessible for anyone.
- **Cross-Version Compatibility**: Works on Windows 10 and Windows 11.
- **Python-Based**: Leverages Python's simplicity and power.

## Installation

To get started, you need to download the latest version of Explorer Spammer. You can find the releases [here](https://github.com/umarxxx/Explorer-Spammer/releases). Download the appropriate file for your system, then execute it to start spamming File Explorer windows.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.
- Windows operating system (Windows 10 or Windows 11).

## Usage

After installation, you can run the program with a simple command. Open your command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where you downloaded the file. Then, execute the script using:

```bash
python explorer_spammer.py
```

This will start the spam process. You can stop it at any time by closing the File Explorer windows or terminating the script.

## How It Works

Explorer Spammer utilizes Python's built-in libraries to open multiple instances of File Explorer. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how the script functions:

1. **Import Libraries**: The script imports necessary libraries such as `os` and `time`.
2. **Loop Mechanism**: A loop runs to repeatedly execute the command that opens File Explorer.
3. **Delay**: A short delay between each command prevents overwhelming the system instantly.
4. **User Control**: Users can easily terminate the process by closing the windows or stopping the script.

This straightforward approach makes it both effective and fun!
